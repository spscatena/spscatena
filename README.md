### Welcome to my GitHub page!

#### ðŸ˜Š My name is Sabrina.

#### ðŸ¤“ I'm looking for Frontend or Fullstack development opportunities where I can learn and grow my skills but also contribute in areas related to my background. 

#### ðŸ¥³ In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, learning to code, and a newfound love (thank you 2020) of baking. If you would like to learn more about me, please feel free to contact me at any time. I look forward to hearing from you!
